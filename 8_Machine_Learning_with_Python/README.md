## Introduction

- Definition: Machine Learning is the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" (Arthur Samuel)
- How ML works?
  - Data -> Feature Extraction -> Rule Set -> Results
- Major ML techniques
  - Regression/Estimation - Predicting continuous values
  - Classification - Predicting the item class/category of a case
  - Clustering - Finding the structure of data
  - Associations - Associating frequent co-occurring events
  - Anomaly detection - Discovering abnormal and unusual cases
  - Sequence mining - Predicting next events
  - Dimension Reduction - Reducing the size of data
  - Recommendation systems - Recommending items
- AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning
- Python libraries for ML
  - Numpy - Efficient computations
  - SciPy - Toolbox
  - MatPlotLib - Plot
  - Pandas - Data Structures
  - SciKit Learn - ML
- SciKit Learn
  - Free software
  - Classification, Regression and Clustering algorithms
  - Works with NumPy and SciPy
  - Great Documentation
  - Easy to implement
- Supervised vs Unsupervised
  - Supervised: Labeled data
  - Unsupervised: Unlabeled data
