# Python for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence - Summary
## Made by Pablo Nunes
----
## Types
- Integers -> Int
- Real Numbers -> Float
- Words -> str
- It's possbile to use typecast to convert a type to another. Like a int to a float, even a str to a int, but be careful, errors can occur.
- Boolean -> Bool
- True or False

## Expresions and Variables
- Expressions are operations that python performs.
- Python follows mathetical conventions in order of operations
- Variables store values to later use
- It is good to use meaningfull names 
- Python normally use snake case

## Strings
- In Python, Strings are a sequence of characters.
- Used in single and double quotes
- Each character can be acessed by using its index
- You can use negative indexes
- Can split, concatenated, multiplied.

## List and Tuples
- Tuples are a ordered sequence
- Uses parentheses and separated by commas
- (1,2,3,4)
- All types can be inside a tuple
- Can be acessed by index, can be concatenated and split.
- Tuples are immutable
- List are a pouplar data structure in python
- [1, 3, 4]
- Lists can be nested, split, concatenated and changed.

## Dictionary
- Uses a key to correspond to a value
- {"Meme": 1912, "Key": 4}
- You can add values, see all the keys and values in a dictionary.

## Sets
- Are a type of collection
- Sets only have a unique type of elements
- {"1", "2", "4"}
- Sets can be added values, use mathematical operations like diagrams.
  
 ## Conditions and branching
- Comparison operators compares some value or operand then based in some condition, it produces a boolean.
- Logic Operations take boolean variables and transform into other booblean variables

## Loops
- The for iterate according to the range associated.
- Using enumerate serves a function to numerate each part of the list
- The while only stops when the condition is met!
