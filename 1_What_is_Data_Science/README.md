## Advice to new Data Scientists

- Be curious
- Argument and judge our assumptions
- Comfort and flexibility with analytics platforms
- Ability to tell a story
- Competitive advantage - To understand some aspect of life where you exceed beyond others

## Data Science process step-by-step

- **Establishing Data Mining Goals**
  - **Identify the key questions**
  - Determine the expected level of accuracy and usefulness of the results obtained
  - Keep in mind the cost benefit trade-off to set the goals and scope of data mining
- **Selecting Data**
  - The output of data mining depends upon the quality of the data being used.
  - The type of data, its size, frequency of collection have a direct influence on the cost of data mining.
  - **Identify the right kind of data that could answer questions**.
- **Preprocessing Data**
  - Important process in data mining
  - Raw data is messy, contains erroneous and irrelevant data, other times there is information missing.
  - By preprocessing data, it is important to identify the irrelevant attributes of data, take them out and identify the erroneous data. **Data must be subject to checks to ensure integrity.**
  - You must know how to deal with the missing data. Using a formal method and determine if is missing randomly or systematically.
  - If data is missing in a systematic manner, determine the impact of the missing data. Because it can lead to a systematic bias.
- **Transforming Data**
  - Determine the appropriate format in which the data must be stored.
  - Reduce the number of attributes needed to explain the phenomena. This may require to transform data.
  - Variables may be transformed to help explain what is being studied.
  - It's often needed to transform variables from one type to another.
- **Storing Data**
  - The data must be stored in a format that gives read/write privileges to the data scientist.
  - Data safety and privacy must be a concern for storing data.
- **Mining Data**
  - This step covers, data analysis methods and machine learning algorithms.
  - A goos starting point is to visualize the data.
- **Evaluating Mining Results**
  - This step is a formal evaluation of the results.
  - Includes: Test of the predictive capabilities of the models. As a in-sample forecast.
  - Data mining and evaluation is a iterative process that is used to improve the algorithms and the results generated in light of the feedback from the key stakeholders.

## Applications of Data Science

- All forecasts are useful but wrong!
- Avoid data hubris, and believing too much in your model.

## Data Science Reports

- A data scientist must be capable to make a essay and report which uses insights to build the narrative to communicate the findings.
- It can be a small document with tables and plots or a really big one.
- Steps:
  - Think about the structure of the report. It depends on the length of the document.
  - The deliverable follow a format. Cover page, table of contents, executive summary, detailed contents, acknowledgments, references, and appendices.
- The **cover page** must include the title of the report, names and affiliations, contacts, name of institutional publisher, and the date of publication.
- **Table of contents**, must list tables, figures.
- **Abstract** to get to the point quickly.
- **Introduction**
- **Methodology**. introduce the research methods and data sources used for analysis, explain the data. 
- **Results**, presenting the empirical findings
- **Discussion**, craft the arguments building on the results prior. Using narratives to enable numbers. Highlight the findings solving the puzzle.
- **Conclusion**, generalize findings and identify future developments in research and applications.
- **References**, **acknowledgements**, **appendices**.
- Is it a good report?
  - Told the readers what they gain by reading your paper
  - Aim of work clear
  - Significance of the contribution
  - Set the work in the appropriate context with sufficient background
  - Practical and useful
  - Identify future developments that may result from this work
  - The paper structure is clear and logical
